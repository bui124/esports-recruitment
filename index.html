        <h1>Warriors Recruitment Application</h1>

        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>
            During the day I work at Westcliff University, within the Athletics department as a coordinator for the esports program. One of my main responsibilities is recruitment. I believe creating a form that goes beyond the simplicity of a Google Form would be incredibly beneficial for my work.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals and Objectives:</h3>
        <p>
            Iâ€™d like to create a form that has validation and allows for users to submit relevant information to the recruitment process. 
        </p>

        <h3>Target Audience:</h3>
        <p>
            High school students and college students.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <p>
            Validation for form fields related to the games they play, their user tags, roles they are interested in, year in high school, and contact information.
        </p>
